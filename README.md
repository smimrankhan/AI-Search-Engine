# Xarvis - AI Search Engine

Xarvis is an AI-powered search engine built with Streamlit and LangChain, capable of retrieving information from the web using multiple sources like Wikipedia, Arxiv, and DuckDuckGo. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to process and respond intelligently to user queries.

## Features
- **AI-powered search**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo for intelligent responses.
- **Multiple data sources**: Retrieves information from Wikipedia, Arxiv, and DuckDuckGo.
- **Interactive chat interface**: Provides a user-friendly chat experience with real-time responses.
- **Secure API key input**: Users can input their API key through a sidebar.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the web-based interface.
- **LangChain**: For handling AI-powered search and tool integration.
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo**: The LLM used for generating responses.
- **Wikipedia API**: Retrieves relevant information from Wikipedia.
- **Arxiv API**: Fetches scientific articles from Arxiv.
- **DuckDuckGo Search API**: Performs web searches for relevant information.
- **dotenv**: Manages environment variables securely.
